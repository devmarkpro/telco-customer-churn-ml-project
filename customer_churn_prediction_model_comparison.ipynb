Churn refers to customers who leave a service provider, and predicting churn is crucial for improving customer retention and business profitability.\n\nThe problem is formulated as a supervised learning task, where the goal is to predict a binary outcome, whether a customer will churn (Yes) or not (No).\n\nSince the target variable is categorical with two possible outcomes, this is a binary classification problem. Various classification algorithms will be explored and compared to build a robust predictive model.\nThrough this project, I aim to understand which features most strongly influence customer churn, evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC, F1-score), and identify the best-performing supervised learning approach for this classification task.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Source\n\nThe dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains customer information from a telecommunications company, including demographic details, account data, services subscribed to, and whether the customer has churned. The target variable is Churn, indicating if the customer left (Yes) or stayed (No).\n\nThe dataset is publicly available on Kaggle: [Telco Customer Churn – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)\n\nIt includes 7043 samples and 20 features, with a mix of numerical, binary, and categorical variables.\n\nThere is also a more extensive version of this dataset published by IBM, which includes more features and additional records:\n[IBM Telco Customer Churn (extended version)](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113)\n\nHowever, for the scope of this project, we use the Kaggle version due to its simpler structure, which is more manageable for demonstrating supervised learning techniques within the project constraints.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Dataset Explanation\n\nThe dataset consists of 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (20 features + 1 target variable). It is in tabular format, with each row representing a customer and each column representing a demographic, service-related, or account-related attribute.\n\nAmong the features:\n\n- 13 are categorical (e.g., gender, InternetService, Contract)\n- 3 are numerical (tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges)\n- 5 are binary (SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, etc.)\n\nThe dataset is self-contained (not multi-table) and does not require external data merging. It is relatively small in size (under 1 MB), making it manageable for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.\n\nHere's the full list of columns in the dataset\n\n* ``customerID``: Unique ID for each customer\n* ``gender``: Gender of the customer (`Male` or `Female`)\n* ``SeniorCitizen``: Indicates if the customer is a senior (`1` = Yes, `0` = No)\n* ``Partner``: Whether the customer has a partner (`Yes` or `No`)\n* ``Dependents``: Whether the customer has dependents (`Yes` or `No`)\n* ``tenure``: Number of months the customer has been with the company\n* ``PhoneService``: Whether the customer has phone service (`Yes` or `No`)\n* ``MultipleLines``: Has multiple phone lines (`Yes`, `No`, or `No phone service`)\n* ``InternetService``: Type of internet service (`DSL`, `Fiber optic`, or `No`)\n* ``OnlineSecurity``: Whether online security is included (`Yes`, `No`, or `No internet service`)\n* ``OnlineBackup``: Whether online backup is included (`Yes`, `No`, or `No internet service`)\n* ``DeviceProtection``: Whether device protection is included (`Yes`, `No`, or `No internet service`)\n* ``TechSupport``: Whether tech support is included (`Yes`, `No`, or `No internet service`)\n* ``StreamingTV``: Access to streaming TV (`Yes`, `No`, or `No internet service`)\n* ``StreamingMovies``: Access to streaming movies (`Yes`, `No`, or `No internet service`)\n* ``Contract``: Type of contract (`Month-to-month`, `One year`, `Two year`)\n* ``PaperlessBilling``: Whether billing is paperless (`Yes` or `No`)\n* ``PaymentMethod``: Method of payment (`Electronic check`, `Mailed check`, etc.)\n* ``MonthlyCharges``: Monthly amount charged to the customer\n* ``TotalCharges``: Total amount charged over the tenure\n* ``Churn``: Target variable.

Customers who churn tend to have much shorter tenure, suggesting they leave early in their customer lifecycle. This is clearly visible in both the boxplots and pairplots, where churned customers are concentrated at low tenure values.\n\n`MonthlyCharges` also shows a moderate association with churn. Customers who churn are more likely to be paying higher monthly fees, which might indicate dissatisfaction or affordability issues. Although the relationship is weaker than with tenure, it still adds meaningful information.\n\nOn the other hand, `TotalCharges` is highly correlated with `tenure` (correlation coefficient ≈ 0.83) and is largely derived from it. While it does reflect overall customer spending, it may not add much independent value for churn prediction and could introduce multicollinearity if used alongside `tenure`.\n\nTo verify this, we computed the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each feature. The VIF score for `TotalCharges` was 9.53—close to the commonly used threshold of 10—indicating a high degree of multicollinearity. In contrast, `tenure` and `MonthlyCharges` had acceptable VIF values of 5.84 and 3.23, respectively. This supports the conclusion that `tenure` and `MonthlyCharges` should be prioritized, and `TotalCharges` should be excluded from linear models or used cautiously depending on the modeling technique.\n\nIn conclusion, `tenure` and `MonthlyCharges` are significant numerical features for predicting churn, while `TotalCharges` shows redundancy and multicollinearity risk that may affect certain models.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Categorical Features Analysis\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For categorical features, we first plot the distribution of each feature based on their values (categories) and then analyze their correlation with the target variable `Churn`.

It plots the **True Positive Rate (TPR)** against the **False Positive Rate (FPR)** across different thresholds. The main summary metric is the **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**, the higher the AUC, the better the model is at classification.\n\nFrom the ROC curve and AUC scores:\n\n- **CatBoost** achieved the highest AUC of **0.84**, showing it is the best at separating the two classes among all models tested. This indicates that CatBoost has strong ranking performance, even though its accuracy is not the highest.\n- **Random Forest** follows closely with an AUC of **0.829**, also performing well in distinguishing churners from non-churners.\n- **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** both performed similarly with AUC scores around **0.825** and **0.823**, respectively. These models are still effective, but slightly weaker than the ensemble methods.\n\nOverall, **all four models performed better than random guessing (AUC = 0.5)**, and ensemble models like CatBoost and Random Forest provided more reliable class separation, making them strong candidates for this churn prediction task.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Model Performance Comparison\n\nTo evaluate the models on the Telco Customer Churn dataset, we used five classification metrics: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC AUC**.

However, because the dataset is imbalanced, accuracy alone is not a reliable measure. A model may achieve high accuracy simply by predicting the majority class more often.\n\n#### Precision and Recall\n- **Precision** reflects how many of the predicted churners were actually correct. SVM had the highest precision (0.519), showing it was more selective when predicting churn.\n- **Recall** shows how many actual churners were successfully identified. CatBoost performed best in this metric (0.810), meaning it identified the most churners, which is important for customer retention strategies.\n\n#### F1-score\nThe F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. SVM and CatBoost scored similarly (0.615 and 0.614), showing that both have a balanced trade-off. SVM slightly favors precision, while CatBoost favors recall.\n\n#### ROC AUC\nThe ROC AUC score shows the model’s ability to separate churners from non-churners across all thresholds. CatBoost achieved the highest score (0.840), indicating it is the best at ranking customers by their likelihood to churn.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nEach model has its own strengths:\n\n- **CatBoost** is the most suitable when the goal is to capture as many churners as possible. It has the highest recall and AUC, making it ideal for reducing customer loss.\n- **SVM** is more balanced and has the highest precision, which could be useful when false positives are costly.\n- **Random Forest** shows consistent performance but does not lead in any specific metric.\n- **Logistic Regression** performs reasonably but is slightly weaker than the other models in most aspects.\n\nIn conclusion, **CatBoost** is the best model for this churn prediction task due to its strong overall performance, especially in recall and AUC.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature Engineering\n\nFeature engineering means creating new features or changing existing ones to help the model learn better.

It can help the model understand that customers who have been with the company longer and pay more might be less likely to churn.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Load and preprocess data\ndf = load_and_preprocess(\n    filepath=DATASET_PATH,\n    drop_aux=True,\n    encode_binary=True,\n    map_gender=True,\n    one_hot_encoding=True,\n    scale_numeric=True,\n    to_numeric=True,\n)\n\n\n# Split features/target\nX = df.drop(columns=[TARGET_COLUMN])\ny = df[TARGET_COLUMN]\n\n# Split train/test\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Scale numeric features\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nnum_cols = ['tenure', 'MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges']\nX_train[num_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(X_train[num_cols])\nX_test[num_cols] = scaler.transform(X_test[num_cols])\n\n# Model 1: Baseline Logistic Regression\nlr1 = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=500)\nlr1.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred1 = lr1.predict(X_test)\ny_proba1 = lr1.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]\n\nresults = {}\nresults[\"Logistic Regression (no new feature)\"] = {\n    \"accuracy\": accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred1),\n    \"precision\": precision_score(y_test, y_pred1),\n    \"recall\": recall_score(y_test, y_pred1),\n    \"f1\": f1_score(y_test, y_pred1),\n    \"roc_auc\": roc_auc_score(y_test, y_proba1),\n}\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.008386Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.008749Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.443861Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.008722Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.443116Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Model 2: With Interaction Feature\nX_train2 = X_train.copy()\nX_test2 = X_test.copy()\nX_train2['tenure_MonthlyCharges'] = X_train2['tenure'] * X_train2['MonthlyCharges']\nX_test2['tenure_MonthlyCharges'] = X_test2['tenure'] * X_test2['MonthlyCharges']\n\nlr2 = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=500)\nlr2.fit(X_train2, y_train)\ny_pred2 = lr2.predict(X_test2)\ny_proba2 = lr2.predict_proba(X_test2)[:, 1]\n\nresults[\"Logistic Regression (with interaction feature)\"] = {\n    \"accuracy\": accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred2),\n    \"precision\": precision_score(y_test, y_pred2),\n    \"recall\": recall_score(y_test, y_pred2),\n    \"f1\": f1_score(y_test, y_pred2),\n    \"roc_auc\": roc_auc_score(y_test, y_proba2),\n}\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.447431Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.448315Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.858071Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.448278Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.857315Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Save results to CSV\nresults_df = pd.DataFrame(results).T\nresults_df.to_csv(f\"{RESULT_PATH}/{RESULT_FINE_NAME}-interaction-feature.{RESULT_FINE_EXT}\")\nresults_df","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.859892Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.860253Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.87738Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.860227Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-04T20:38:39.876414Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Feature Engineering Analysis\n\nFeature engineering is the process of creating new variables or modifying existing ones to help machine learning models learn better from the data. In this case, we introduced an **interaction feature** by multiplying two numerical features: `tenure` and `MonthlyCharges`. The new feature, named `tenure_MonthlyCharges`, is designed to capture the relationship between how long a customer has been with the company and how much they pay each month.\n\nThis interaction can provide extra information to the model. For example, customers who have both high tenure and high monthly charges might behave differently in terms of churn compared to those with only one of these factors.\n\nTo evaluate the effect of this feature, we used **Logistic Regression** as a **baseline model**. Logistic Regression was chosen because it is simple, interpretable, and sensitive to linear relationships between features and the target variable. This makes it a good starting point to observe the impact of new feature additions.\n\nWe then compared the model performance with and without the new interaction feature:\n\n| Model                                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score | ROC AUC |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Logistic Regression (original)      | 0.787    | 0.619     | 0.513  | 0.561    | 0.832   |\n| Logistic Regression (with feature)  | **0.789** | **0.624** | **0.519** | **0.566** | **0.832** |\n\n#### Evaluation\n\n- After adding the interaction feature, all performance metrics improved slightly, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n- The ROC AUC score remained nearly the same (0.832), suggesting that the model’s ability to rank churners versus non-churners did not change significantly. However, the improvements in other metrics show better predictive performance.\n- These results indicate that the new feature contributes positively to the model's ability to separate the classes.\n\nAlthough the improvements were modest, they were consistent across all key metrics. This shows that even a simple interaction feature can help the model perform better. The experiment also demonstrates how Logistic Regression, due to its simplicity, can serve as an effective baseline for evaluating feature engineering efforts.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusion\n\nThis project explored customer churn prediction using the Telco Customer Churn dataset through a complete machine learning pipeline: from data cleaning and exploration to model evaluation and feature engineering. The dataset was moderately imbalanced, requiring techniques like SMOTE to address bias during training.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed several important patterns. Features such as `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `Contract`, and use of services like `TechSupport` or `OnlineSecurity` showed strong associations with customer churn. We also identified multicollinearity between `TotalCharges` and other numerical features, which informed our model selection and feature usage strategies.\n\nMultiple classification models were developed and compared using consistent preprocessing pipelines and evaluation metrics. Among them:\n\n- **CatBoost** achieved the highest AUC (0.840) and recall (0.81), making it the most effective model for identifying churned customers.\n- **SVM** offered the best balance between precision and recall and had the highest accuracy (0.749).\n- **Random Forest** provided consistent performance across all metrics, and its feature importance analysis confirmed the value of previously identified predictors.\n- **Logistic Regression**, used as a baseline, also performed reasonably well and was extended in a feature engineering experiment.\n\nWe introduced a new interaction feature (`tenure * MonthlyCharges`) and evaluated its effect using Logistic Regression. The addition led to small but consistent improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, confirming the benefit of feature engineering.\n\nIn conclusion, CatBoost is the most suitable model for churn prediction in this context, especially when recall and ranking performance are critical. The project also highlights the importance of proper preprocessing, careful metric selection for imbalanced data, and the value of domain-driven feature engineering. Future work could explore additional interaction features, model ensembles, or deployment strategies for real-time churn risk scoring.\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
